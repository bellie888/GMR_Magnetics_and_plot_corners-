# GMR_Magnetics_and_plot_corners-
This software is for calculating some of the inputs into the Surface NMR survey work.
It allows the user to input several paramenters, calculated the properties of the magnetic field at a given 
location and time, then produces various data sheets, shapefile, GPX file and csv file for use by the team.
The user dosn't need to use Python code because a user interface is utilised.


DEPENDENCIES:
    pyprj and shapefile and the only to dependancies besides a standard Python 2.7 install
    
The script needs to be kept in the folder with the agrf2015 FORTRAN code.
The script runs from the folder and uses the sub-folders in there to store the outputs. 
Subfolder required are:
    GPX
    Output_Data_Sheets
    Plots_Data
    shapefiles
